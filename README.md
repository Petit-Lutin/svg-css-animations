# Testing CSS animations with svg

## cat-switch-casual-corporate 🐱☕️

I made the illustration from a doodle on paper, traced a lineart with Krita, and added the colors with Inkscape.

Using a single svg file, adding some classes and animation to make the cat switching between casual wear and corporate wear.

Demo can be seen [here](https://petit-lutin.github.io/svg-css-animations/cat-switch-casual-corporate/).
